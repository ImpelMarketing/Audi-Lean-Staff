            Lean Staffing and Manual Follow-Up Create Lost Opportunities in a
            Tight Market

              Concerned about an uncertain economic environment and fluctuating
              demand, the team at Audi Denver needed to control costs while
              improving productivity, and that meant doing more with an
              already-lean staff. Attempting to respond to every inquiry, follow
              up with each lead, send and answer emails, handle routine
              questions set up appointments, and track every channel (while
              delivering a great experience for every shopper) was straining
              team resources - and impeding their ability to prioritize
              ready-to-buy customers. Increasingly, the team had to make
              judgment calls about which opportunities to chase and which leads
              to drop. Staff members were forced to abandon lea ds that had been
              sitting in the CRM for some time, including shoppers who took
              longer to respond or had gone dark.

              The result? Lead follow-up dwindled to ju st a few days -yet those
              are precisely the opportunities that become a key source of
              business when the market begins to cool.

            "We were already seeing early signs of a decline in leads, and with
            backlogged inventory finally coming in, we needed to make
            conservative decisions abdut costs - especially overhead and
            staffing. We're always busy, so this was stretch- ing our sales
            teams thinner than ever. We needed solutions to help us be more
            productive and eficient - without adding headcount!‚Äù
